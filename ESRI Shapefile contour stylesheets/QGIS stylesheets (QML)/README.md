# OS Terrain 5 contours

These are QML files for OS Terrain 5 contours in ESRI Shapefile format for use in QGIS.

*They have been designed to work with the data as it is supplied.*

## Quick start guide

**1.**  Fork or [download](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/OS-Terrain-5-stylesheets/archive/master.zip) the contents of this repository

**2.**  Load your OS Terrain 5 contour  ESRI Shapefile data (line and point) into QGIS

**3.**  Double click on a layer to access the 'Layer Properties' window > click on 'Load Style...' > navigate to the directory containing the QML files (those ending .qml) > select the QML file that corresponds to that layer > click 'Open' > click 'OK'

*Repeat step 3 for both layers*

**4.**  We recommend the following layer order:

We recommend viewing the data between **1:1,000** and **1:25,000** for maximum legibility

Your data should now look similar to this:
